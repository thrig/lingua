\section*{Translation Notes}

Experimental gismu are used though the translation hopefully cleaves to
what has been called Old High Lojban as seen in the book ``The Complete
Lojban Language''. There are likely many problems with the Lojban (that
I am not fluent in) plus errors or distortions caused by the translation
from Spanish (that I am also not fluent in).

\begin{itemize}
\item The tense in Lojban does not use ``storytime'' so gets set to the past \textit{puki} then is moved around (usually forward with \textit{ba}) as the character does things. There are likely problems with this.
\item \textit{desembarcar} became \textit{flukla} as I didn't like \textit{selma'ebi'o} and couldn't find anything better.
\item \textit{unánime} is tricky; ``sharing the same view'' is one meaning but (spoilers!) the ``one mind'' aspect is relevant. Hard to pun on that in Lojban. \textit{tugysi'u} would be literal; I went with \textit{jundi} which hopefully is keeping to the spirit of things.
\item \textit{censa derpesxu} would be more literal for \textit{fango sagrado}; instead took the liberty of \textit{latna derpesxu} as the Lotus has mental connotations in traditions both East and West.
\item \textit{patria} to \textit{jbegu'e} ``birth country'' misses the head of family (or, spoilers, body) aspect.
\item \textit{el recinto circular que corona un tigre o caballo de piedra}\ldots I am uncertain if the circular part crowns or is crowned by the stone animal.
\item \textit{rió abajo} became \textit{fa'a le ve rirxe} thanks to \textit{la gleki}; prior to that the Lojban probably said ``under the river''.
\item \textit{cicuta} got munged to \textit{carmalri'a spati} which hopefully is turn-bad-causing plant after the Greek ``konas'' or ``to whirl'' or what Hemlock (perhaps) is named after.
\item \textit{en lustros} (minus the religious connotations) became \textit{mumei} though perhaps is nonesense as I've used it.
\end{itemize}
