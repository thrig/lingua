 * camxes - make https://github.com/lojban/ilmentufa useful from CLI
 * lefanva - converts lojban XML dictionary into sqlite for mitysisku
 * lujvo.hs - make https://github.com/lynn/jvoxaskei useful from CLI
 * mitysisku - lojban dictionary tool
 * nimi - toki pona dictionary tool
 * sapgli - highlights basic english in input text

required packages for OpenBSD

    doas pkg_add espeak ffmpeg ghc node
    make depend

rumor has it node (in camxes) is called something else on Linux;
portability has not been tested beyond OpenBSD 6.4 and Mac OS X 10.11

see also the Lingua::Awkwords perl module which is a more complicated
yet more flexible method to perform the same work as sitelen-sin.c
